<p>High supply voltage are needed if we need to add more load (light bulbs, electric heaters, air conditioner etc) in the series circuit. Lets start with the series part of the circuit. For example, you may need an 800w led driver, but you can parallel 500w and 300w to get the 800 wattages you desire. If you have 3 led cobs, each with a forward.

<p>The anode is the positive side of the device. Where a series circuit receives the same current to each led, a parallel circuit receives the same voltage to each led and the total current to each led is the total current output of the driver. It does work, if polarities are kept right and adequate power is supplied. Since the leds are in series, they all have the same current through them, and will therefore have the same brightness.
