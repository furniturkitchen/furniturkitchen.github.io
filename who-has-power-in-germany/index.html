Germany sources 65 of electricity production from renewables in last From reneweconomy.com.au
The maker of the solar power system says it has doubled its business in germany so far this year, citing higher demand after the invasion of ukraine. An aerial view shows isar nuclear power plant, which includes the isar 2 reactor, on august 14, 2022 in essenbach, germany. The main justification for germany’s nuclear shutdown is the risks associated with using nuclear energy. Germany itself has over 6,000 mw of installed pumped storage capacity, but the german grid is serviced by a further 3 gw sourced from luxembourg, switzerland and austria.
