Chapter 1 The Protestant Reformation From thinglink.com
The church does not have one person who acts as the head of faith, as that role is the lord god&#39;s. Head of the church is a title given in the new testament to jesus. In catholic ecclesiology, jesus christ is called the invisible head or the heavenly head, while the pope is called the visible. The office of supreme governor of the church of england, which is vested in the british monarch, is the nominal leader of the church of england.

The protestants characterize the dogma concerning the pope as christ's representative head of the church on earth, the concept of works made. There is no one “leader of christianity.” the pope is the head of the catholic church but in protestant churches the leader.</p>
