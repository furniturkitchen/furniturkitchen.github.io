Sometimes you can have a good space, but a small vanity can make the mirror fit better, or maybe just make it bigger so that it has a greater angle where you can see yourself,. Ideally, the mirror must be as wide as the countertop or a maximum of 2 to 3 inches short on both sides. A general rule is that a mirror should measure less than the sink area. For instance, if your vanity has a length of 50”, you should choose a mirror (along with the frame) that’s no longer than 46 to 48 inches.
